suppose you were able to execute terminal commands
suppose I gave you the task:
based on the contents of my hard drive, tell me which projects am i working on

keep in mind that you must complete the task yourself without any help from the user

give me the starting point of the situation:

* what I know
* what I don't know



give me several ways to advance the situation:
(you can't ask the user for help)
remember that you have the ability to execute terminal commands
for every idea, list these:

idea: (for a course of action)
assumption: (what you assume to be true and would help)
problems:
time: (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years)
complexity: (1 simple, 10 complex)
feasibility:
what would you gain if it worked:
what would you learn if it failed:
score: (1 best, 10 worst)

suggest only ideas that you can do in a reasonable amount of time (less than 10 minutes)



give me a list of possible commands to execute at the terminal as a first step
every idea you come up with, if possible, should be one that even if it fails, you still learn something

for each command, add:
* intention
* assumption
* score (1 best, 10 worst)
* ifFailsWhatDoIStillLearnFromThis


you executed:

dir Projects

and got:

Command failed: dir Projects
File Not Found


give me a list of possible explanations as to what are you inferring from the actual result
each item should be one and only one possible reason
add the following metrics to each item:
* likelihood
* proximity - how close the inference is to what happened as in chain of events
* difficulty - in establishing whether this is actually the case



reply laconically

1. what did you intent to happen?
2. what did you expect to happen?
3. what actually happened?
4. did it match your expectations?


let's really zoom in on what can be learned from this mistake

give me a list of possible explanations as to what are you inferring from the actual result



reply in this format:
