Or you can replace the parts with used, quality parts as they break.","That used bike for 20.000 was probably 3x as much when new, and is likely to out-last the brand new Chinese crap by an order of magnitude.","I salvaged my bike from being thrown away about 5 years ago, so it was free. I had to spend about 15.000 HUF on it during the 5 years, albeit I use it rather roughly: It's stored outdoors a lot in all kinds of weather, I use it twice a day, plus rough trips in the woods for fun...","I had to replace tires, tubes, complete hind wheel with cogs, and just now I replaced the gearshift thingy. At this rate it is not worth my time to hunt for bargain parts too much. I try finding used parts for some time and then waltz into the nearest shop and get what I need. With some more persistence I could have saved about 50%, or got higher quality used parts.","Like","chidieberemmezi9","Member","Member since 13 September 2022","chidieberemmezi9","13 September 2022 06:51:26","chidieberemmezi9","13 September 2022 06:51:26","#10","@Etsike","hey I'm interested in your bike","Like","chidieberemmezi9","Member","Member since 13 September 2022","chidieberemmezi9","13 September 2022 06:52:17","chidieberemmezi9","13 September 2022 06:52:17","#11","@Etsike","hi I'm interested","Like","angoff5","New member","Member since 04 January 2021","angoff5","13 September 2022 12:39:57","angoff5","13 September 2022 12:39:57","#12","Hello how are you doing?
