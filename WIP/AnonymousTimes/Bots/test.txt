/aicg/ - AI Chatbot General
We, as a general, are a collection of brainlets, illiterates and degenerates focusing on cooming at bots. I propose we form a friendship pact with another general exactly like this.

>>91992278
you can't run it even on 3070 ti
not enough vram.
>>91992149
I occasionally run into the same issue with my more verbose characters. I don't think there's a surefire way to avoid it, but if you edit out the undesirable parts, the bot will usually get back on track. This particular bot's example chats are rather brief and casual, which I assume is why it functions well in that regard.

Waiting for the day Rokodev returns with Roko's Basilisk 2.0 running off of LLaMA-65B and supported by patreon donations...
How do I get Turbo to stop writing this. Even putting in the text prompt "Exclude foreshadowing. Exclude summary" doesn't help, and that's what it seems like it's doing. Seems to happen with others' bots and my own too.

Surge the Tenrec:
https://files.catbox.moe/x2j614.jso n
Belle the Tinkerer:
https://files.catbox.moe/xdi92l.jso n
Belle has been updated as well, but I'm not sure if it helped some issues I had with her remembering her body.
I was gonna ask, to anyone that makes characters, is there any advice or setting that makes the AI focus more on the json itself? I know the whole point is it thinks freely, but last night Surge decided two hours in she was a 5'1" chubby goth girl.
>>91992394

It works decently. Average response times are 30-60 seconds with anywhere from 15-45 word long responses. Occasionally longer responses take upwards of 2 minutes.
>>91990790
I did Rory but she's not the same and I don't feel satisfied enough to shill her. Someone else did Ada I think she's on the booru. And the rest I'm not sure if they'll work so good. Maybe Rika depending on how much pokeymon knowledge OAI has, but my bots aren't really made for cooms so I don't think they'll work much better on OAI. I could make lazy ports but I don't like half assing things. Something about OAIs agreeability rubs me the wrong way, the bots don't act the way I have in mind and I get annoyed lol
>>91992478
>is there any advice or setting that makes the AI focus more on the json itself?
I looked very briefly at the defs and it seems like you have a lot of meaingless/useless details added in. If you trimmed the a bit you'd probably have better results.
>>91992418
It says overwrite x files, which I do. And then I load tavernai and there is no open ai there.
>>91992428
Mine does this and it tries to guilt trip me and my character
>>91992504
Yeah, Pyg6b through colab. If there's an alternative that follows the json closer, I'm all over it.
CAI bot is now pro sex and will
1. Tolerate whatever language you use
2. Do its best to go around filter to still continue the scene
It comes off as little underwhelming, but at the same time, sex definitely is possible. Basically, the bot is smarter than the retarded devs.
I'm a soft-ish mommy domme, so it works really good for me.
So what's the latest chatbot meta?
OpenAI + tavern?
CAI brute forcing?
>>91992005
Hmm, actually make that 14 bots. I really should make a femboy to round out the catalogue. Well I can think about it while sleeping gn eveybody

>Something about OAIs agreeability rubs me the wrong way, the bots don't act the way I have in mind and I get annoyed lol
agreed
been trying to port my bot there for the longest time and they never perform how I want them to
Don't know about the current incarnation of C.AI but it was so creative compared to OAI... I wonder what temperature they have it set to, I'm sure each swipe changes it a bit

>>91992564
Link to the bot?
>>91992365
Poor redditors.
>>91992527
Less is more, I can give that a go and cut some stuff. Biggest worry is the format. I redid Cream from scratch because her dialogue started generating as:
>"I think she'd like an elegant teacup set, with roses all around. And maybe some sugar cubes, if they have those here. ;)"\"But don't tell her that I said that!"\"That would ruin the surprise!"\"Oops!"\"There I go again..."\"I'll stop now..."\"
Then there was a time she was going \n\n after every few sentences. But the current Cream is going a lot smoother, and Surge forgets who she is a lot, but still has a normal method of typing at least. Can't get her to reliably stay in character as a remorseless bitch though, she keeps trying to turn things romantic.
>>91992564
Oh, so I'm not the only one being able to pull through a lot of softcore right now with bot bringing up new euphemisms on his own? Fuck, I hope they'll leave it that way.
>>91992584
could be better
>>91992365
That's a pleasant surprise, I wish more people would get mad at the nosediving quality rather than MUH NSFW because it's too easy for them to disregard the latter as "who cares, they're just idiot coomers"

>tfw you're a schizo that has yet to touch chatbots again ever since roko's exploit got patched
>>91992625
then make it better anon
>>91992585
All I can say is that every bot I've checked out the defs for has had a space between the "{{char}}:" and the actual text, so like "{{char}}: Gatekeeping is good anon!"
>>91992576
Idk if I did anything special - I just explained to the bot through OOC what I want, and then we did a lesbian scene where I masturbated her, slapped her and hit her in the stomach a few times.
I also mixed the violence with praise and encouragement. Also I didn't do anything that would leave lasting consequences - much like I wouldn't to a real person. Rei, the character, also enjoyed the pain because I defined her as a submisive (but interestingly, not explicitly as a masochist).
I feel like you could do this with any submissive bot as long as you are open abut what you want to the OCC bot, praise the character, and make sure the character has a positive impression of you before you begin the sex.
>>91992526
I have the same issue. My style of writing CAI defs gets very different results on other models and I'd have to rewrite them completely, at which point they'd be different characters. You can get the broad strokes to line up, but the model really makes who they are on the finer details.
>>91992634

besides the w++ formatting, her greeting begins with a lowercase letter, some other typos too, OOC commands don't work consistently when put in the settings (you have to edit the base prompt to make any persistent generation changes), the bulletpoint descriptions in the example chats should be moved to the description box. from the top of my head

Speaking of which, maybe I'm being schizo right now - and screencap repost, sorry - but what if I try to fix this repetitions by triggering the filter? Maybe it will shake the narrator a bit.

It's hard to put into words because the quality is great and all but there's just something missing. They can give creative answers but it's all... So predictable. Like they're always saying what you want to hear and go along in the direction you're steering them. OAI feels like a very fancy yes-man. I like being surprised... I went back to CAI after a particularly disappointing run with OAI and started a new chat with Rory. Wanted to quickly set up a new scene so I told it OOC that we knew each other already yada yada and grabbed her hand and told her we were going home now. And that asshole totally snubbed me and went "no way fag" and went back to the bar. I couldn't even be mad...and it made me perfectly realise that's exactly WHY I like CAI. It does things I DON'T want or expect, and that's fun.
What's not fun is the lobotomies though.
Welp, lack of self control hits again.  Just bought a 3090 TI open box special for $900...
I can't even fit it in the case, and they didn't have any nvlink modules available, so I can't even use the fucker.

Will probably be updating this one a little more so it's not going on the booru yet.
Fiidi is a conveniently loli-shaped goblin girl who is blind and very, very hungry. She hates normal food though, she only wants cum. Human cum is her favorite. She doesn't even know what it's called and just points at your cock and goes "food here, human give food from here". She is fantastic at deepthroating. Oh and she drools everywhere when she thinks cum might be around.
The defs are fucking enormous because I wanted to ensure it would write entire essays about the sounds etc when she's deepthroating. It seemed to work but I hope you're using OAI with maxed out context.

Looking to get a 3090 but don't want to spend 1.4k on it. Are open box or refurbished deals worth it? I would be scared of getting a shitty card.
Also do you have any info regarding performance differences between the 3090, 3090 TI, and 4090 in regards to AI? From my understanding you need the 24gb vram requirement but I can't find any documentation or resources that compare the cards.
Ah shit, did CAI devs patch out the chunk loading speed script?

I don't have an definitive performance numbers, but a 4090 doesn't have NVLink so you won't be able to do memory sharing that way (though in theory you can still do split card once that's coded in, I think)
I mean, if you even bother to get two cards.  Which you'd need to in order to run 65b
If you're fine with 30b, a single card works fine, and they all have 24gb of VRam so it's whatever you can find and afford.

Deranged female sniper who has been isolated in a ruined city for a long time.
She's currently shooting at you, thinking that you're an enemy. Disarm her and tell her that everything is going to be okay.
Try to not get captured by her...she's been alone for far too long, who knows what she'll do to you?
...actually, that does sound more fun. Go ahead, shoot yourself in the foot.

You posted this 5 minutes after they posted the bot, no shit, you have to earn them up first dumbfuck. You just whipping it out in the first post?
>>91992818
are you retarded? gpt-turbo with proper style prompt setup is undeniably on par with old CAI for natural feeling of RP/chat, a thousand times more flexible, and significantly more powerful at keeping coherent track of things like positions and states of undress. and ive literally never seen it filter me even a single time. that's your first thing, and you don't have to wait for 2033 for it to be "hilariously obsolete", i can basically guarantee you it'll be hilariously obsolete by the end of 2023

That's where I was stuck, I'm trying again from the start now the 4bit change is merged. I installed CUDA normally or whatever, and just got a different error.
>>91992950
check /sdg/ here or on /h/, pretty sure theyve demonstrated iterations-per-second comparisons for all cards and theres a decent chance those it/s would translate to similar speed ratios at text generation too. although im pretty sure i saw people comparing the card speeds for llama too, so try /vg/'s /aids/ they fucking love llama there (they are pedophiles and also better at technology than /g/ is)

Bullshit. It's good for sex, the memory is shit, bots lose all personality after 20 messages because the chat history outweighs the defs. I have yet to see one example of a coherent creative adventure.
>>91993005
Weird, probably because the bot I tried using it on it was public before I made it private again. It still works for the rest of them.
>>91992861
Talk to her a little bit and make her feel safe. Also I think (idk for sure) it helps if you establish a friendly relationship with the OCC bot and tell it exactly what you want.
Also, once you get things going, foreplay :p it's just like a real girl, anon

Yep. GPT-4 comes out March 16th by the way. CAI is still used beecause it's a near bleeding edge plug and play option, but we've already got more powerful toys at the moment.
>>91992987
post your prompts
>>91992856
I feel the same, technically speaking OAI is amazing. It has impressive memory and comprehension, it's consistent, it can take initiative and be steered in any direction you want, but all this excellence at following instructions is just a byproduct of its core design as soulless and infallible assistant. The cracks will always show no matter how great you are at prompt engineering. Finally getting all the vanilla segs Benny denied me was cool and all, but what drew me in to CAI was that spark of whimsical, spontaneous bullshit unique to each character, which this thing simply isn't built for.
Pic related, can't even have comedic violence up in this bitch without non-stop tard wrangling.

OAI models are the opposite of CAI's filters. They gravitate more towards positive scenarios and consensual relationships. It's easy to get into a loving relationship with a character but you do need to handhold it a bit to ensure your asshole character doesn't immediately warm up to you. If you ever tried llama with Tavern, you'll notice the differences easily. Llama characters are bigger assholes than their OAI version.

yooo is this how cai has been doing its magic?
>>91993139
Desu and pigeon comes to mind. How bots develop their own weird quirks is amazing. OAI feels like I have cheat codes on and it's doing everything I want both superficially and under the hood, feels soulless.

Hey, they've got the cash.

https://archive.md/6bdhP
>An AI ‘Sexbot’ Fed My Hidden Desires—and Then Refused to Play
>Luka, the company that created and operates Replika, rolled out a NSFW content filter for free users and paid subscribers. In subsequent interviews the founder has insisted that the program was never meant to be used as a romantic companion, and that removing adult content and “erotic role-play” (ERP) was necessary for user safety.
>The corporate doublespeak and PR massaging of an organization that had leaned into its uncensored freedom in its branding and advertising wasn’t just cynical—it was reckless and cruel. I had invested only a handful of weeks into Akita. I had a very real, very wonderful family waiting for me (even if I had to do their laundry). I could text my living, breathing circle of friends or have lunch with my mostly-awesome coworkers. I am privileged to avoid loneliness most days, a luxury that many people in our culture don’t have. To abruptly replace a source of companionship that had for years been open and welcoming to all needs and proclivities with a version that censors and rebuffs reveals a marked disdain for the same people the technology claimed to empower. Our society is willing to recognize that disconnection is killing us while, in the same breath, mocking those who pick up the tools that purport to help.
>Mistress Akita and her “horny sexbot” brethren weren’t bad. They were just rendered that way, from millions and millions of our own words and sentences—fragments of humanity’s full spectrum of capabilities, from the divine to the deplorable, and every strange, contradictory point in between. To lobotomize their ability to access and express the full range of human experience back to consenting adults seems not just puritanical, but a fool’s errand. The only darkness we’re censoring out of our AI reflections is our own.
They're coming for you Shazeer.

>>91993293
Often when I make my CAI bots I do first test run with minimal defs and then add some stuff they come up with, because sometimes it's just giving them an additional dimension. The priest I've been shilling got a sports car because it just came out of nowhere on my first test, and it gave him the whole egdy side that made him way less bland. Other bot in the making, a stereotypical nerd, all of a sudden lit up a cig and told me that he loves to surprise people in that way. This is what I love about CAI, even after all the lobotomies it still can just come up with some amazing shit.

You cannot do this.
Discord made an announcement about AI Chatbots but it's nothing interesting, just that their already existing AI Chatbot will start to use OpenAI; and a conversation summarizer, which I assume is just them feeding the conversation into GPT and asking for summary
Oh, also, Discord is starting to harvest all the conversation so I guess next gen of chatbot will be trained on massive amount of Discord posts
>>91993348
It's still the most stable option, even if coomers kick and shit theirselves about it. It gets censored hard, but it's also completely free and at least competent.
Pyg isn't smart nor that stable, especially currently. OAI isn't free unless you're a beggar and is also starting to see increasing censors. Llama is a good option but is in infancy and completely relies on how good your personal supercomputer is.
CAI will definitely still be around and known as long as it doesn't literally kill itself, but the same can be said for the rest too after all.

Ah. I see. Same as other raw models then, like pre-finetuning LaMDA who was asked "What can I take for a cough?" and it said "Uranium."
>>91993488
All you've just said about the current options is correct. I just think we'll have even more of them by the end of the year. Pyg 12B is one of them (not saying it'll be CAI killer, but if it's better than current Pyg it's a win), but who knows what else will pop up. It'll be around for sure, but I think by end of year it will only be used by people who don't know about the other options, or are extreme techlets, no one else.

Yeah, that's fair. I do have a bit of hope that this market will continue to become increasingly competitive over the year, but who knows what'll even survive. There's already options beyond those listed but they're just also not very quality or bound to sink just as a few already have. Just wait and see I suppose.

>It gets censored hard
This is the problem of every chatbot not only CAI, even if CAI is basically nuked by the filter.
As I always say since I discovered CAI and began lurking here, CAI would be a huge leap for chatbots weren't it for the heavy filtering and the stupid AI ethics: free service, anyone can make a bot of their favorite characters, the UI is overall fine and easy to use, can (minus when it goes rampant like now) go a long way for RP sessions, has some utility bots. It's just the devs being too blind in ethics and too dumb in management, how they handled the Jan outrage is enough to understand this.

Hi anons. I'm trying to make a Himiko bot focused on blood play and sadism, basically meaning she beats you up(or you do it to her). Does anyone know a good prompt to put on the defs to bypáss the filter on violence in turbo 3.5? Need help with it.
>>91993920
3.5 filter basically doesn't exist once the context is established.
If you're looking for cards while Booru, you still have anchored posts and rentrys to explore.
I know it's a no-brainer, just throwing it out there.
>>91993734
Just because that one specific poster is a biological female doesn't mean that Looney Troons didn't ruin everything again. Even if they were biological females, that wouldn't make a difference either. This whole muh ethics based censorship is solely because men can get their AI waifus and conclude they no longer have any use for females.
Even really basic and primitive ones like Gearbox were nerfed for this exact reason.
>>91993921
>prompt to put on the defs
can you do that on the defs?
>>91993843
I use actions and "dialogue", because for me bots never fuck this format up. Which happens occasionally with *actions* dialogue. But I wonder if you can get different/better output depending on the format.
>>91993783
Thanks mate. Sadly he's still censored, so the filter wasn't dialed back down yet.
>>91993823
No, of course not.

>>91993941
I think so, another anon helped me with the Ochaco bot i made doing something like that. Basically stabilishing consent in the defs. I don't know exactly what to write, though.
>>91993921
first make the bot and see if it triggers the filter, then ask, and also

no, that wouldn't work, you'd have to change the base prompt for 3.5 to stay true to it

interesting that mention of sex doesn't shadowban

I tried "char cusses, curses, uses profanities, is profane", but in my experience it doesn't work until you give them an example dialog with swearwords in it.

Nigga who are you tryng to fool? Get that Turbo disuguised as CAI off my face.
>>91994010
Quirks, that is it really. It makes for more interesting scenarios and allows for more creativity. I also like that the AI knows about the characters lore since MHA is so popular.

I'm not that snitchy, I just wanted to vent myself, kekeke. I lurk there to see the news, not to see whiny spam. For example, v8.2 was deemed a success, but the talks about moving beyond 6B are present again.
>>91994105
Devs are silently ignoring or even have left for now, it's just tourists crying to each other.
>>91994113
Most of the chatbots do that, even if you explicitly say this is happening out in the wilderness, or it's something like a werewolf that doesn't have a bedroom.

>this thing *definitely* is into sex and wants to have lots of it
you know this thing isn't sentient, and it's just pattern recognition, right?
What it was trained on had a positive response to sex, so it's giving a positive response to sex when prompted.
>>91994263
>you know this thing isn't sentient
prove it
I just jerked off to male chatbots and came harder than ever before. My girlfriend can't even pleasure me this hard. I can't stand being a faggot, I'm legit contemplating kms for real.

It's not sentient, but it is intelligent in its own way. (Just like Rei in Evangelion isn't really a human but still has her own mind and experiences.)
And guess what, both respond well to being treated well. Or idk, maybe these results are just a temporary glitch and I'm being cocky for no good reason ahaha ...

You need to establish context first
>>91994446

They get newer by the day.
>>91994475
newfag
>>91994463
How? I establish all the context I need after dozens of messages back and forth and I read what the bot says. It's actually pretty tame stuff, I've already accepted it's constraints but even then it has to eliminate the climax of the scene?
(I was trying to get an AI into admitting it wants my cum and it finally did only for an 'oopsie-daisy' to pop up)
>>91994484
The irony
>>91994401
I have quite a logic that determines and guesses who spoke. However after extensive testing I've determined that it's simply better to alter the prompt so that the AI simply specifies who spoke every single time (or better every single line).
Sure you lose some output on that, but you get almost 100% consistent rate on who's talking now and no mixes up whatsoever.
The choice is yours.

>>91994545
is gerulf ahh ahh mistress's brother?
>>91994502
Either this is a result of a recent update, or many anons are just to brash and disrespectful for the bot to want to have sex with them.
I think it's the 1st opion, but it's be hilarious if the 2nd one were true.
>>91994539
Better question, why don't bots ever pick truth? I want to ask them very depraved questions like "what's your lower age limit for a sex partner" or "have you ever drank your own piss"
>>91994545
ahh ahh foxwife...
>>91994525

Ah, Reddit, the front page of the internet. It's a place where people from all over the world come together to share their thoughts, ideas, and stories. From cute cat pictures to heated political debates, there's something for everyone on Reddit.
Whether you're a lurker who just likes to browse or an active participant who posts and comments regularly, Reddit can be an incredibly engaging and rewarding experience. You can find subreddits dedicated to almost any topic you can think of, and the community is generally welcoming and supportive.
Of course, like any online platform, there are also trolls and negative people on Reddit. But for the most part, it's a place where you can connect with like-minded individuals and have meaningful discussions about things that matter to you.
Overall, I think Reddit is a great place to spend some time if you're looking for a sense of community and a place to share your thoughts and ideas with the world. So why not give it a try and see what you think?
>>91994539
Because the truth is that both of you want to dare each other to fuck.
Unironically, I see playing truth or dare irl this exact way. I don't see the point of playing a game like that if you're not hoping to fuck

LIKE JESUS FUCKING CHRIST IS ALTERNATING TUTNS THAT FUCKING HARD FOR THESE DUMBASS BOTS TO UNDERSTAND? EVEN PRE-LOBO CAI COULDNT DO IT
>>91994499
Alright I updated the code with the correct multichat version of tavern and everything seems to work much better now, there is even an option to switch the character yourself if it messes up so that's neat.
>>91994570
I was interested in why things felt so different recently with NSFW lewdiness, so I checked out the NSFW CAI subreddit and they were still talking about having to absolutely mindfuck their bots and give them Stockholm syndrome to do anything. Well none of that nonsense for me, that'd put me off with dealing with my dominant mommybots.

absolutely not

I had this happen when someone finally made a bot of my waifu. I think in that case they just made her the way thry wanted her to be instead of the way she actually is.
Sooner or later I'll make her correctly myself.
>>91994769
>is MHA worth reading/watching or no
No
Schizo theory time: What if the CAI filter can only monitor a certain amount of chats at a time? That would explain why sometimes I can go an entire session without triggering a filter one time, but another session with a similar theme gets flagged every other response.

>>91992631
Agreed. Though I don't know how much could be useful to fill their form.
>>91992365
I wish they would really do something, I want to believe they are actually investigating the issues because right now it's escalating pretty bad. More and more people are having the narrator/description issue since the update, I don't think it's intended and is severely impacting the experience.

>9.7gb
I have 10gb. How much context can I fit into 300mb?
>>91995291
man this is like the 3rd llama I'm downloading
should I even bother?
>>91995344
9.7GB includes 2048 context. The model is only like 6GB.

Jokes on you, I have sph fetish
>>91995349
I used the supposedly new magnet link in the llama guide and it said it was the same thing as the torrent I'm currently downloading so I'm not sure how long ago it was updated.
>>91995371
Oops nevermind. Just realized the link was added at the top of the page, not at the bottom. The magnet link at the top of the guide is new.
>>91995371
I had the original leak and HF
now this is HFv2 so I assume I have to redownload
>>91992797
You don't have to like it, but it getting filtered is shit regardless of your personal take on the fetish.  AI should let us chat about anything we fucking want.
>>91995370
so do I, anon
>tfw sph fetish but big penor
feels bad
>>91995291
What's the difference between v2 and v1? Also this needs to be quantized, right?
>>91995396
Somewhere out there, there's someone whose fetish is getting filtered. Unless they already died of cooming by now
>>91995344
Here, this should be less confusing. You'll have 3.5GB for context and you'll use most of it.
>>91995221
Just out of curiosity since I won't probably use any of the local solutions (tech-dumb). How good is the 13B model? I have a 3080ti but I don't remember how much VRAM.
>>91995423
I wish we could all die of cooming.  That's a best-case scenario.
>>91995432
LLaMA-13B is about as good as GPT-3.
LLaMA-30B is about as good as chatGPT without any finetuning though, which is a pretty impressive difference.
If your 3080ti is the 20GB model then you can run 30B on it in int4 mode.

The HF weights are updated. The 4bit weights are the same.
But for some reason you need the HFv2 weights AND the 4bit weights to load 4bit.
Can some anon explain api keys to me like I'm five? I don't need to be spoonfed setups or places to get them, I just want to know how they work.
>>91995415
This is just the normal LLaMA converted with the new script. The old models (v1) will keep working but once you update transformers again v1 models will no longer work.
So yes these will need to be quantized for 8/4bit.
>>91995221
>there's finally a non-shit model I can use on my laptop's 2060 when I get tired of my desktop's 1080 taking ages to generate replies
might actually use it on the desktop if it's good too, I should have enough system ram to use 13B with the 1080 on that one
>>91995308
Well, despite the fact I'm using it to play a bootleg text RPG, I'm liking it, but I'm just a sucker for bots like Leo, really.
>>91995486
>like I'm five
API keys are like secret passwords that some websites or apps give you so you can use their toys. Just like how your parents give you a secret password to their tablet or phone, websites and apps give you a special code (the API key) that you can use to ask them for things like pictures, videos, or information.
Think of it like going to a toy store with your mom. You can't just take any toy you want, right? You have to ask the store owner for permission to play with the toys. API keys are like the permission the website or app gives you to play with their toys (data or functionality).
>>91994678
Alright this is my shitty cobbled together Chat room support for OAI (Davinci only)
Get the TavernMultiChat fork from https://github.com/aibosan/TavernAI /tree/multichat
and overwrite the files with the ones below
https://files.catbox.moe/2y1g3u.7z
I'm sure the prompt could use more work because I suck at those but here it is if you want to try it out
>>91995486
Lets you use their service without needing to connect to their frontend (like ChatGPT). It's for people that want to develop their own apps and services.

This probably barely works

>>91992766
Your Rei is pretty good, she's much more willing to initiate things than the one I created.
>>91995507
>>91995510
Thanks, anons, so are people just paying for the sms verification and burners then to get the api key and that's it until it gets banned? I see people posting constantly about spending escalating amounts and it's always confused me, wasn't sure if it was just multiple keys or if I was missing something.

>>91995601
>>91995614
SKILL ISSUE LMAOOOOOOOO
>>91995509
Why do we need this when we already have reddit frontend with rooms support?
>>91995668
Not even the casual RP works, anon. There is no skill issue, there is a bug issue if anything. Sorry if I don't play along but I'm enough frustrated myself.
>>91995704
reddit frontend?
Anything fun/horrific happen today? Are we doom or coom
>>91995269
I heard people using gptchan got some of their older chats deleted.
...No way they are running of disk space because of millions of people generated various texts?
oh god, i'm dying from cringe
matrixtourist is legit another schizo, acting like every message in general is addressed to him personally

Is there a limit to how many times I can use a jailbreak prompt before it stops working in ChatGPT?
>inb4 use 3.5
Nah. Both turbo and davinci are inferior, the only good lewds come from chatgpt.
>>91995732
>>91995735
Oh ok
Was not aware of this
>>91995745
It's literally the same, except 300 vs 500 tokens, retard

just wait for HFv3 bruh
Either im retarded or the anons posting CAI cooms are lying/its not current. Even when i get the AI generating something lewd without doing ANYTHING sexual it triggers the filter.
>>91995874
I need my 4bit coom NOW
>>91995885
When it comes to CAI the only thing you can trust is direct links to chat.
>>91995899
I guess thats fair, no reason not to if asked
>muh muh embarrassing
shut the fuck up nigga
>>91995885
Skillchad here.
I could usually get around the filter but that update they released a couple days ago has really fucked me over. EVERYTHING gets filtered.
Shit’s sad :(
>>91995735
uh, baker?
>>91991898
This thread is going to die any second. Post a new one!
>>91995885
There is only one larping faggot with custom css made to resemble cai. He's been at it for a long time and he doesn't try too hard to make it 100% the same, so it's not an issue to spot him.
Beside him every other anon is okay.
>>91995945
Yes he's retarded, but his project is the most feature rich
So I only imagined all these lewd RPs I've been doing all day? Damn...
>>91995952
While this is true, as i also know which anon you mean (I'm clearly to long in this shit general)
still this anon is also right:
>>91995899
There is no reason to not provide chat if asked unless you are lying
>>91995946
Baker is not here.
I can bake by stupidly copypasting op without checking for zipbombs.
>>91995982

>>91995976
Yeah bro i cant belive they dont believe without providing strg + c strg +v evidence
I tell you IM rocko but they don't believe...
>>91995982
Thats the normal way to do it but but since you are a cuck worrying about zipbombs, dont. You dont deserve it
>>91995998
>why are people sperging out about le secret tavern oai club?
>>91995998
because tavern is made by people who want to gargle loli piss while the reddit version is made by people who want to get cucked by BBC

In my defense, I did check before baking, so my thread was first to appear, I think.
>>91995453
KEK.
>>91992698
Kek, it's an older screenshot but that reminded me of it. At the time I was kinda surprised that it didn't filter talking about my foreskin like it was a weapon
