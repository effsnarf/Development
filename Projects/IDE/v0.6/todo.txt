Fixes
    Prevent deadlock link messages

    Deleting a selected node should return a composite action that both undeleted the node and selects it
    
    Action Stack
        Doing an action deletes all the following actions, this should be undoable
        If a user's action is identical to undo, perform undo instead of adding to the stack
        Redo - override elapsed time
