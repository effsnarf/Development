      - an Oscar Wilde quote, that quotes Oscar Wilde on his views on Software
      Development in a quote.
    teaser: >-
      Software development is the unnecessary, optional, slightly overwhelming
      and constant ever-lasting long-term usage of either needless,
      tautological, pleonastic, superfluous or unnecessary code, by which one
      repeats, in duplication, the same, identical, aforesaid functions over and
      over and over and over and over again, beyond what would be needed or
      required to explain, or make comprehensible, the intended or signified
      functionality of that which one wishes, or wants, to put across and
      convey. These things can be and most likely will be referred to as
      developing software. Usually, it is often common in software development
      to repeat, sometimes with different phrasing or variables, the same idea
      or reasoning, thus restating one's algorithms, sometimes paraphrasing
      oneself and effectively coding the same thing twice, or double, or thrice,
      or three times, triply so or treble of, or a small handful of times, or
      any number of excessive, unnecessary restatements greater than zero
      (none).
