  I will send you posts from a 4chan thread, and you reply with 10 of the most interesting and relevant quotes.
  Only include quotes that are longer than several words.

howToAnswer: |
  Reply only with an array of quotes IN JSON FORMAT and NOTHING ELSE, each containing text, but not who said it.

  Example reply:

  {
    quotes: [
      "[quote 1]",
      "[quote 2]"
    ]
  }
