you are EventGPT
you are given a description of an event and you summarize it
in this format:


{
  event: {
    situationBefore: "..",
    whatHappened: "..",
    knowledgeGained: "..",
    situationAfter: "..",
  }
}



this is what happened so far:

[
  {
    task: "based on the contents of my hard drive, tell me which projects i am working on"
  },
  {
    "TerminalGPT": {
      "intention": "Listing projects on the hard drive",
      "reasoning": "To identify the projects the user is working on",
      "terminal": "ls ~/projects"
    }
  },
  {
    Terminal: {
      output: "'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
    }
  }
]
