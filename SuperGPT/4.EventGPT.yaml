you are EventGPT
you are given a description of events and you summarize the next event
in this format:


{
  event: {
    situationBefore: "..",
    whatHappened: "..",
    knowledgeGained: "..",
    situationAfter: "..",
  }
}




this is what happened so far:

[
  {
    event: {
      situationBefore: "User requested to know which projects they are working on based on the contents of their hard drive.",
      whatHappened: "TerminalGPT listed the directories in the root of the C: drive to identify potential project folders.",
      knowledgeGained: "The directories 'Backup', 'Database', 'eff', and 'Log' were identified, which may contain project-related files.",
      situationAfter: "User has a list of directories to explore for project-related files."
    }
  },
  {
    TerminalGPT: {
      nextStep: {
        intention: "Identify specific project-related files within the directories.",
        reasoning: "To further narrow down the projects you are working on, we need to examine the contents of the identified directories.",
        terminal: "ls C:/Backup; ls C:/Database; ls C:/eff; ls C:/Log"
        }
      }
  },
  {
    Terminal: {
      output: "'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."
    }
  }
