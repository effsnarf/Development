// Velocity
// When the user presses left or right, we want to accelerate smoothly in that direction.
// As long as the user is pressing the key, the velocity increases.
// When the user releases the key, the velocity decreases gradually.
// The velocity is between (0, max).
// The velocity increases by some value per time unit (not frame).
// To accomplish this, we need to know when the key is pressed and when it is released.
// It's easier to accomplish this with another class,

class Velocity {}
